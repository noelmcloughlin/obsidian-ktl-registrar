# Contributing to LOKF Registrar

Thanks for your interest in improving LOKF Registrar!

## Development setup

Node 20+ is required (CI builds on 20, 22, and 24).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/obsidian-lokf-registrar.git
cd obsidian-lokf-registrar
npm install
npm run dev      # esbuild watch mode, rebuilding src/main.ts -> main.js
```

`npm run dev` watches and rebuilds; `npm run build` type-checks and produces a minified production bundle.

To test in a real vault, clone into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/lokf-registrar/` directly, or symlink/copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` there, then reload Obsidian. The [Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin speeds up iteration.

`main.js` is git-ignored (see "Do not commit `main.js`" below), so a fresh clone has no `main.js` at all - Obsidian will show "Failed to load plugin" with nothing in the console, since the loader has no entry file to require. Run `npm install && npm run dev` (or `npm run build` for a one-off) before the first reload, and after every `git pull` that touches `src/`.

### Agent skills (optional - only for editing this repo's own `.lokf/` bundle)

Nothing in the plugin depends on any agent skill, and no plugin user needs one. The skills below concern one thing only: this repository's own `.lokf/knowledge/` bundle, the documentation-about-this-repo that CI keeps in step with the source. Skip this section unless you are editing that.

The bundle is maintained with [lokf-agent-skills](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/lokf-agent-skills), installed, never committed - `.agents/`, `.claude/`, and `skills-lock.json` are git-ignored - and CI installs the librarian skill itself at run time. To work on the bundle locally you need at most two, pinned to the release CI uses (GitHub CLI 2.90+):

```bash
for s in lokf-librarian lokf-curator; do   # derive / confirm concepts
  gh skill install noelmcloughlin/lokf-agent-skills
done
```

`lokf-sidecar` is only for re-generating the `.lokf/` tooling and the two bundle workflows from their template (rare); `lokf-docent` only lets an agent answer questions from the bundle. Neither is needed to contribute.

## Layout

Source lives in `src/`, following the upstream [obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) convention:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.ts` | Plugin lifecycle - commands, status bar, vault scanning, bundle-root resolution |
| `src/settings.ts` | The settings tab |
| `src/validator.ts` | The LOKF rule engine (import-free, plain-Node testable) |
| `src/report-view.ts` | The report pane |

For a realistic LOKF vault to test against, point a scratch vault directly at an existing `.lokf/knowledge/` directory from a project that has one - its root `index.md` should already carry a semantic header for this plugin to check.

## Before opening a pull request

- Run `npm run build` - this type-checks (`tsc -noEmit`) and then bundles, so it must complete without errors.
- Run `npm run lint` - ESLint runs `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd`, which encodes Obsidian's own plugin guidelines as rules. Treat its findings as review feedback from upstream, not as style noise. Two deliberate exceptions live in `eslint.config.mts`, both about vocabulary to ensure OKF/LOKF class names are treated as proper nouns (and `http_method` and `lokf:Concept` are spec compliant names), and `scripts/` is treated as Node tooling that never ships in the bundle. Prefer fixing the code over widening either list.
- The settings tab is **declarative**: it returns definitions from `getSettingDefinitions()` and never builds DOM, which is what puts every setting into Obsidian's settings search. That API is 1.13.0-only, which is why `manifest.json` sets `minAppVersion` to 1.13.0; the imperative `display()` is deprecated and must not come back. Settings backed by a list (the comma-separated ones) are joined and split in the tab's `getControlValue` / `setControlValue` overrides, so storage keeps real arrays while the UI shows text, and persistence goes through the plugin's `saveSettings()` rather than the inherited write.
- Run `npm run smoke-test` - the pure `validator.ts` logic must pass its fixture checks (no Obsidian install needed for this one; it runs under plain Node). If you have another real bundle to hand, point the suite at it too - `LOKF_EXTRA_BUNDLE=<path-to-a-bundle>/knowledge npm run smoke-test` - to catch an over-strict rule the in-repo fixtures wouldn't; it's opt-in precisely so the default suite stays hermetic.
- **`npm run smoke-test` only covers `validator.ts`.** Anything that needs the Obsidian `App` - a vault scan's unreadable-file handling, bundle-root-folder resolution, the scaffold command's target-picking - has no automated test (there's no headless Obsidian to run one in) and must be checked by hand in a real vault first.
- **Do not commit `main.js`.** It is generated and git-ignored; the release workflow builds it and attaches it to the GitHub release. (This repo previously tracked it, following another plugin's convention; upstream's `obsidian-sample-plugin` explicitly ignores it, and that is what we follow.)
- Keep changes focused; describe what and why in the PR.
- Follow the existing style: build DOM with `createEl`/`createDiv` (never `innerHTML`), put styling in `styles.css`, and register events via `registerEvent` so they unload.
- `validator.ts` covers two layers: the LOKF semantic layer, and the OKF v0.2 base layer the LOKF schema already subsumes (a required `type`, the `Attested Computation` shape, reserved `index.md`/`log.md` structure, and v0.1→v0.2 migration hints), gated behind `checkOkfBaseLayer` so a vault running a dedicated OKF validator can turn it off. Keep both to *shape* only - never the credibility *depth* or trust-tier verdict of the §5 fields, and never runtime attestation (executing a computation, inspecting a receipt); those stay a consumer's job. The `okf/*` rules are the base layer; the `lokf/*` rules are the semantic layer.
- **Keep `validator.ts` import-free.** It takes already-parsed frontmatter and pulls in nothing - not Obsidian, not a YAML library - which is what lets the whole rule set run under plain Node in the smoke test. Parsing belongs in `main.ts`, which uses Obsidian's own `parseYaml`.
- **Refreshing the vocabulary manifest.** `src/lokf-vocab.json` (the type/predicate/genre vocabulary, plus each field's description for the *Look up a LOKF field* command) is generated from a pinned LOKF schema by `node scripts/build-vocab.mjs` - a maintenance step, not part of `npm run build`. Re-run it only when bumping the pinned schema, and commit the result. It prefers `lokf vocab --all --json` (install the [`lokf`](https://pypi.org/project/lokf/) toolkit so it is on `PATH`) and falls back to reading `../lokf/lokf.yaml` from a sibling checkout, so an absent or older `lokf` never blocks the refresh; `src/fields.ts` then only chooses which fields to surface and in what order, taking each description straight from the manifest.
- CI runs two more gates that are easy to trip locally: `lint-and-docs.yaml` (ShellCheck, `actionlint`, markdownlint against `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, link-checking, and codespell over every `*.md`) and, on any `.lokf/**` change, `knowledge-registrar.yaml` (`lokf validate` over the bundle - the registrar keeps records well-formed, it never judges whether their content is true). If you touched a workflow or a shell script, expect `actionlint`/ShellCheck to have an opinion.
- Pinned action SHAs and npm devDependencies are bumped by Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`), not by hand - don't float a pin to a tag to get a newer version.
- The PR template's checklist is the short version of this section; fill it in rather than deleting it.

## Code of conduct

Participation here is covered by the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), the same one `lokf-agent-skills` and LOKF Curator use.

## Using AI tools

AI assistance is welcome here - this repository's own `.lokf/` bundle is maintained by an agent, and the plugin exists to make agent-written knowledge checkable. What that requires of you is unchanged: you are the author of whatever you submit, you are responsible for understanding and defending it in review, and an agent may not participate in discussion on your behalf. The full rules, including how this repo's own scheduled `knowledge-librarian` agent is held to them, are in [AI_COVENANT.md](AI_COVENANT.md).

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with your Obsidian version, OS, plugin version, and steps to reproduce.

## Releasing (maintainers)

The version number is no longer hand-picked. Write `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` as you go - the same section you already keep current for each change - and describe what changed with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) type (`feat:`, `fix:`, `security:` for a patch, `BREAKING CHANGE:` in a footer, or `!` after the type, for a major). Open the PR as normal.

**Only `feat:`, `fix:`, `security:` and a breaking-change marker cut a release.** `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `style:` and `test:` deliberately do not: a branch carrying only those merges cleanly, releases nothing, and leaves its `## [Unreleased]` entries to ship with the next release that does. So type the commit for what the change *is* - a user-visible behaviour change is a `feat:` even when most of the diff is prose. If a PR should release and its commits are typed too quietly, squash-merge it and give the squash commit the right type.

Once it merges to `main`, [`semantic-release.yml`](.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml) does the rest:

1. Computes the next version from the commits since the last release. Nothing lands if none of them warrant one.
2. Refuses to proceed if `## [Unreleased]` is empty (`.github/scripts/changelog-release.mjs check`) - this pipeline releases only what's already been written up, never a bare version bump.
3. Retitles that section to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and inserts a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and bumps `package.json` (which triggers the existing `version` script - `manifest.json` and `versions.json` update exactly as they did under `npm version`, `.npmrc`'s `tag-version-prefix=""` included).
4. Commits those files and creates the bare `X.Y.Z` tag Obsidian requires.

5. Calls [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) as a reusable workflow (`build-and-attest`), which builds, attests provenance, and opens the release as a **draft** carrying `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`. Review the draft and publish it by hand. It is called rather than tag-triggered because a tag pushed with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not re-trigger workflows; a hand-pushed tag still fires `release.yml`'s own `push: tags:` trigger and takes the same path.

Step 3 onward runs behind the `release` GitHub Environment - **configure required reviewers on it once, in this repository's Settings → Environments**, or every qualifying merge ships unattended. `semantic-release.yml`'s own header comment has the full design and why each piece is shaped the way it is.

A hand-pushed tag (`git tag 0.2.0 && git push origin 0.2.0`) still works exactly as before, going through the same `release.yml` - useful for a hotfix or recovering from an automation problem, not the normal path.

### What the repository settings mean for you

Two are worth knowing because they explain what a pull request waits on, or refuses:

- **Changes reach `main` by pull request, but the rule is not enforced by a ruleset.** A ruleset that requires pull requests rejects every direct push, and the release job's own push - the changelog promotion and tag in step 4 - cannot be exempted from it: a ruleset bypass list accepts roles, teams, GitHub Apps and Dependabot, and `github-actions[bot]` is none of those. So the pull-request discipline here is a convention, held to by the maintainer, not a gate. Open one anyway. Required status checks are off for the same reason - that rule is applied to direct pushes too, and rejects the release job's `[skip ci]` commit for having no checks of its own. CI still runs on every pull request and is still read before merge; it is just not the thing that blocks one, so treat a red check as your problem to fix rather than a net that will catch it.
- **"Require signed commits" as a branch rule is deliberately off**, and must stay off. A `git commit` made inside a runner is unsigned - GitHub only auto-signs commits made through the web UI or API, and `@semantic-release/git` uses the git CLI. Turning the rule on would reject step 4 above and break every release. Signing your own commits locally is a different thing, nothing gates on it here, and it is still worth doing - see below.

### Signing your commits (encouraged, not required)

A signature ties a commit to you cryptographically, so GitHub shows it `Verified`. Nothing in this repository requires one; it is one setup and free afterwards.

**Choose one format - GPG or SSH.** They are not interchangeable: git reads `user.signingkey` in whichever format `gpg.format` names, so a file in the wrong format fails with `could not load public key`. Either way, `git config user.email` must be a **verified email** on your GitHub account, or commits stay `Unverified`.

**GPG.** The key lives in `~/.gnupg/`; exporting prints it for pasting rather than writing a file you keep. Choose `ECC (sign only)`, `Curve 25519`, and an expiry of 1-2 years rather than never. Record the passphrase in your password manager as you type it - there is no recovery.

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long   # fingerprint is under `sec`
git config --global gpg.format openpgp
git config --global user.signingkey <fingerprint>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
gpg --armor --export <fingerprint>           # paste at github.com/settings/keys -> New GPG key
```

**SSH**, reusing a key you may already have. The file must be a real SSH public key (`ssh-ed25519 AAAA...`), not a GPG export saved under an SSH-looking name:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"   # skip if ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 exists
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub                    # paste under SSH keys -> Key type: Signing Key
```

GitHub keeps authentication and signing keys in separate lists; a key registered only for auth leaves every commit `Unverified`, even though it is the same key. Check your work with `git log --show-signature -1`.

**Renew a GPG key before it expires.** Set a calendar reminder a month ahead of the date `gpg --list-secret-keys` shows. Extending keeps the same fingerprint, so past commits keep verifying:

```bash
gpg --quick-set-expire <fingerprint> 2y
gpg --armor --export <fingerprint>
```

Then delete the old entry on github.com/settings/keys and add the exported key again - GitHub stores the expiry from the copy you uploaded and does not re-read it. An expiry is not a compromise: commits signed while the key was valid stay `Verified`, and only *new* signatures stop. If a key is ever actually stolen, revoke it rather than extending it.

If signing fails with no prompt at all, GPG has nowhere to ask for your passphrase - add `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` to your shell profile and open a new shell. [`lokf-agent-skills`](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/lokf-agent-skills/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#signing-your-commits) has the longer walkthrough.
