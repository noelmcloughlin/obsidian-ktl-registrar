# The signature half of the registrar's provenance gate, with no forge.
#
# The GitHub `provenance` job asks GitHub whether the person named in a new
# `by: human:<id>` line approved the pull request or signed its commit. Off
# GitHub there is no such job, and on GitHub it is the only check. This
# script does the signature half anywhere git runs.
#
# The repository carries one public key per curator id under
# `.lokf/curators/`: `<id>.asc`, a GPG key as `gpg --armor --export` writes
# it, or `<id>.pub`, an OpenSSH public key as `ssh-keygen` writes it, one key
# per line. Every commit in a range that adds, changes or removes a
# `human:<id>` event under the bundle must be signed by a key on file for
# exactly that id. The event is a `verified` entry, or the `generated` record
# the curator's Correct writes. A GPG key counts with every subkey it carries,
# since most keys sign with a subkey. An SSH key is verified with
# `ssh-keygen -Y verify` (OpenSSH 8.2+) against the commit's own payload.
#
# A removal is a claim too. A person's record is never removed without that
# person. A `verified` event every parent held and the commit no longer holds,
# struck out or gone with its concept, needs the same signature as one that
# was added. A person's `generated` record may be replaced by another
# person's, which is what the curator's Correct writes, and that second
# person signs it as an addition. A record replaced by anything else needs
# the signature of the person it named.
#
# `--unattended` is the other half, for a change nobody stands behind: the
# scheduled librarian's. It compares the working tree, staged or not, with
# HEAD, and needs no key and no forge. It reports every way such a change
# touches a person's record:
#   - a `human:` event added, changed or removed in any YAML layout;
#   - a person's note under `## Open questions` added or removed;
#   - text a person wrote, changed.
# knowledge-apply.sh refuses each of these before it writes. This is the same
# refusal, checked on the result, by a job the agent never ran in.
#
# Findings, one line each, exit 1:
#   - the commit is unsigned, or its signature does not verify;
#   - it is signed by a key other than the one on file for that id, or by a
#     key that has expired or been revoked;
#   - the id has no key on file (a stranger, or a curator not yet added), or
#     is not a login any forge could list;
#   - the range adds, changes or removes that id's own key file *and* records
#     a confirmation by them: a key is added in its own reviewed change first,
#     so nobody registers a key and vouches with it in one step;
#   - a commit touches a bundle path git has to quote (`"`, `\` or a control
#     character in the name), which this line reader cannot hold.
# With no `.lokf/curators/` directory it says so and exits 0: there is nothing
# to verify against, and the forge's gate, if any, is the only check.
#
# What a pass proves: the holder of that key made that commit. Not that
# anyone read the source, and not who the person is beyond what the key file's
# reviewed history says. Bash 3.2 and POSIX tools; needs git, and gpg or
# ssh-keygen for the kind of key on file.
