#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Record one reader-feedback entry in .lokf/feedback.md without reading it.
#
# ktl-docent appends a Miss or a Disagreement here and ktl-librarian consumes
# it. Entries already in the file are other readers' reports: free text that
# can come from someone with no access to this repository. The file is kept
# newest first, so adding an entry used to mean the docent read it, edited it
# and wrote it back. Those reports then entered the session of an agent that
# had just been fetching URLs and reading repository files, held off by
# nothing but a line of prose telling it not to act on them. This script does
# the insertion instead. The caller hands over its own entry and never opens
# the file, so no other reader's text reaches the model at all. The guard is
# the call, not a rule an agent has to keep (docs/threat-model.md,
# "Prompt-injection guards").
#
# It prints one line - the kind, the date, and how many entries now wait - and
# never any entry's text, the new one included. A caller that wants to show
# the reader what it recorded already has that text; it does not need this
# file to tell it.
#
# Bash 3.2 and POSIX tools only, so it runs on macOS's stock bash and on Git
# for Windows, like the other scripts here.
#
# Usage:
#   knowledge-feedback.sh [--root <dir>] [--for <login>] <kind> <text>
#
#   kind    Miss or Disagreement, in any letter case, and nothing else - the
#           two shapes ktl-librarian knows how to consume.
#   text    the entry itself, one argument. Whitespace is collapsed, so a
#           multi-line string still lands as one line per entry.
#   --for   an authenticated login (gh api user --jq .login, or glab), which
#           records the entry as `- docent, for human:<login>`. Left out, the
#           entry is `- docent` alone. Never a name typed in conversation and
#           never git config user.name: the attribution is only worth carrying
#           if the forge stands behind it.
#   --root  the repository root (default: the nearest ancestor of the current
#           directory holding .lokf/, else the current directory).
#
# The day heading is today in UTC, as the bundle's own timestamps are, so two
# machines in different zones file one day under one heading.
#
# Exit: 0 recorded; 2 the call was wrong and nothing was written; 1 the file
# could not be written (a read-only .lokf/, most often, or another run holding
# it), and the caller should tell the reader the gap out loud instead.
