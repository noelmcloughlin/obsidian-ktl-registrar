#
# Wrapper for the scheduled knowledge-librarian loop (Karpathy rule).
#
# `.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml` invokes this script directly: a
# fixed, reviewed path, not an arbitrary command from a repo variable. To turn
# on the scheduled run, set the `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_ENABLED` repository
# variable to "true". Then set `AGENT_CLI` (repo variable or secret) to the
# command that runs your coding agent non-interactively, for example the GitHub
# Copilot CLI or an internal agent runner that accepts a prompt on `-p`/stdin.
#
# CONTRACT (the workflow relies on this):
#   - The agent WRITES one file, .lokf/patch.yaml, and nothing else. After it
#     returns, this script applies that file with knowledge-apply.sh. So
#     .lokf/knowledge/, a handled feedback.md entry and the ledger line it
#     becomes in questions.md change only through that script, and a run in
#     which the agent changed any other path is refused.
#   - What the pen refuses before it writes is then checked on the result, by
#     knowledge-provenance.sh --unattended: a run that touched a person's
#     event, note or text is refused too.
#   - The lines the patch file holds for the reviewer, its `handoff`, reach
#     the file KNOWLEDGE_HANDOFF_OUT names through the same script, cleaned.
#     That file and the retrieval score's are removed once the agent returns,
#     so what the workflow reads from them was written after it.
#   - It MUST NOT git commit, push, or open pull requests: the workflow owns
#     that.
#   - On success it exits 0 whether or not it changed anything; the workflow
#     diffs the working tree to decide whether to open a pull request. A run that
#     knowledge-report.sh finds quiet, when the caller allows a skip, ends
#     with exit 0 before the agent is called.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   AGENT_CLI           command that runs the agent given a prompt via -p "<prompt>"
#   AGENT_API_KEY       optional: the agent's API key or token, from a secret
#   AGENT_API_KEY_ENV   the name the agent reads that key from, such as
#                       ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; required when AGENT_API_KEY is set
#   KNOWLEDGE_SKIP_QUIET optional: "true" skips the agent when
#                       knowledge-report.sh finds nothing waiting for it; the
#                       workflow sets it on a scheduled run, never on one a
#                       person starts
#   KNOWLEDGE_HANDOFF_OUT  optional: a file to write the patch's hand-off lines to
#   KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL optional: "true" scores, after the bundle is written,
#                       whether the index leads an agent to the concept behind
#                       each question readers asked (one more agent call)
#   KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_OUT  optional: a file to write that one score line to

Task (Karpathy rule - continuous small corrections, not a rewrite):
  1. Follow the skill's Scrape & build procedure: bootstrap discovery if the
     bundle has no real concepts yet, otherwise the steady-state refresh of the
     sources recorded in the bundle (concept provenance and
     .lokf/knowledge/playbooks/knowledge-sources.md). Start a refresh from
     "bash .lokf/scripts/knowledge-report.sh worklist" where that script
     exists: a program has already found which sources moved, which notes a
     person left, and how much reader feedback waits.
  2. Reconcile the .lokf/ knowledge bundle with the repository: add missing
     concepts, correct stale facts, wire typed relations, and give every
     operation its log line - but only when the bundle content actually
     changed. If nothing changed, write no patch file at all; do not log
     administrative no-op runs.
  3. Write every change as an operation in .lokf/patch.yaml, in the shape
     "bash .lokf/scripts/knowledge-apply.sh --format" prints, and check it
     with "bash .lokf/scripts/knowledge-apply.sh --dry-run". Do NOT edit any
     file under .lokf/knowledge/, .lokf/feedback.md or .lokf/questions.md
     yourself, do NOT run the apply script without --dry-run, and do NOT run
     git, open PRs, or touch any other path: this wrapper applies the file
     after you finish. Cite sources for any claim whose authority is outside
     the repository.
  4. Mark concepts you create, and claims you cannot settle from the
     repository, as \`status: draft\` (with a plain-prose "## Open questions"
     section for the latter), exactly as the skill says. Put what the person
     reviewing the pull request should know, and that is no change to the
     bundle, in the patch file's "handoff" list, in your own words and never
     a reader's. The workflow writes the rest of the pull request itself, and
     your final reply reaches the job log only.

# Security rationale (for human and automated reviewers): AGENT_CLI is trusted
# configuration, not untrusted input. A repo admin sets it in Settings, naming
# their own agent command, and it is never derived from repo contents, pull
# request data or model output. It is parsed into a quoted argv array and run
# directly (see below), so bash does NOT re-evaluate it as source. Shell
# metacharacters (; | & $() ``) are passed as inert arguments, not executed:
# there is no eval and no `bash -c`. This step runs only in the workflow's
# read-only `refresh` job (contents: read, no persisted credentials), and the
# post-run check also fails if the agent wrote anything but .lokf/patch.yaml.
#
# That check, and the AGENT_CLI invocation itself, live inside main() below,
# called only from this file's last line. Bash reads a function body in full
# before running any of it, so an agent that truncates this script mid-run
# cannot make it skip anything after the agent call. Top-level statements, as
# these once were, run only as far as the file's length on disk when bash
# reaches them.
#
# Split AGENT_CLI into an argv array (whitespace word-split, no globbing) and
# invoke it as a quoted vector rather than a re-expanded string. Handles the
# usual "cmd --flags" form. Quotes *inside* AGENT_CLI are not honoured, so keep
# it to a plain command plus flags, or wrap richer logic in its own script.
