# The pen, the librarian's only way to write the bundle. ktl-librarian
# describes each change to the bundle as an operation in .lokf/patch.yaml, and
# this script, run through knowledge-apply.sh, checks every operation and
# writes the files. The agent never edits .lokf/knowledge/ itself, so what
# reaches the bundle is what this script allows. It:
#   - stamps `generated` from the clock;
#   - keeps a concept's description and its two index bullets equal;
#   - files each log line under the day's heading;
#   - moves a feedback entry an operation says it handled out of feedback.md
#     and into the ledger of questions readers asked, ten to a patch at most;
#   - refuses an operation that would write a `human:` actor, rewrite text a
#     person wrote, or delete a concept a person confirmed or left a note on.
# Nothing is written unless every operation passes.
#
# Two things hold for every concept it writes, whatever the operations were.
# A person's record is the same after as before: each `human:` event and each
# note in a person's name, read as knowledge-provenance.sh --unattended reads
# them. And a frontmatter value the operation did not name keeps the text the
# file held: YAML reads `1.10`, `0123456`, `12:30:00`, `yes` and an unquoted
# time as a number, a boolean or a date, and written back from that they
# would read `1.1`, `42798`, `45000`, `true` and a time in another shape.
#
# `--format` prints the patch file's shape. So the format comes from the
# script that enforces it, and a host needs no particular release of the skill
# to learn it. ktl-librarian's references/patch.md carries the same block, and
# the repository contract checks that the two are equal.
#
# A patch may also carry `handoff`: at most ten lines for the person who
# reviews the change, in the librarian's own words. They are never written to
# the bundle. The script accepts each only as one line of printable text,
# with no backtick, and prints them; `--handoff <file>` also writes them there, which
# is how the scheduled wrapper passes them to the pull request. A reader's
# question, which goes to the ledger, is cleaned the same way.
#
# The dependency block above names one PyYAML release, and `exclude-newer`
# takes no file uploaded after its date, so every run installs the files
# that were there when the pin was set. Move the two together, here and in
# knowledge-conventions.py.
#
# Operations (each a mapping under `ops:` with `op:` and `path:`):
#   create    frontmatter + body for a concept that does not exist yet
#   patch     edits (replace / insert_after / append) and `set` frontmatter keys
#   rewrite   a whole new body; the lokf:related block and open questions carry over
#   question  one open question, in the curator's shape, with this run's actor
#   resolve   withdraws one open question this run's actor asked; never a person's note
#   recheck   this run's own `verified` event, replacing its previous one
#   delete    the concept, its index bullets, and a log line saying why
#   reindex   both index bullets re-derived from the frontmatter; the concept itself is not touched
#
# Usage: knowledge-apply.py [--dry-run] [--keep] [--handoff <file>] --root <repo-root> [<patch-file>]
#        knowledge-apply.py --format
#   exit 0  applied, or with --dry-run would apply; or the format was printed
#   exit 1  findings; nothing written
#   exit 2  usage, no bundle, or a patch file that cannot be read
