# What a program can say about a bundle, so that no model has to work it out.
#
# A concept's trust label, the bundle's health line and the librarian's work
# list are arithmetic over frontmatter, git history and two small files. A
# skill that has a model do that arithmetic gets a different answer on a
# different day: two label rules were corrected in prose before this script
# existed. So the skills run this script and quote what it prints. It reads
# the bundle and git; it writes nothing, and it prints no reader's words
# except inside the one prompt `retrieval --prompt` builds.
#
#   knowledge-report.sh                    the whole report: ktl-curator's Step 1 starts from it
#   knowledge-report.sh health             the one health line
#   knowledge-report.sh labels [<path>..]  one line per concept, in the shape of ktl-docent's footer
#   knowledge-report.sh worklist           where ktl-librarian starts: paths and dates only
#   knowledge-report.sh quiet              exit 0 when nothing waits for the librarian, 1 when work does
#   knowledge-report.sh changes            what the working tree does to the record, against HEAD
#   knowledge-report.sh retrieval --prompt the index-only question an agent is asked
#   knowledge-report.sh retrieval <reply>  that agent's reply, scored
#
# Every form takes `--root <dir>` first: the repository root, by default the
# nearest ancestor of the current directory holding .lokf/. A <path> is a
# concept's path inside the bundle, such as playbooks/release.md.
#
# The labels, in the words ktl-curator and ktl-docent use:
#   confirmed by a person        a `verified` event whose actor starts human:
#   edited since a person last   `generated.at` is later than the latest such
#     confirmed it               event, the two times compared whole; such a
#                                concept is counted here and not as confirmed,
#                                since the person confirmed an earlier text
#   checked by automation only   `verified` holds events, none a person's
#   nobody has checked this yet  no `verified` event at all
#   still a draft                `status: draft`
#   past its review date         `stale_after` is today or earlier
#   a reader disputed this       a reader's Disagreement that names the
#                                concept waits in .lokf/feedback.md
#   retired                      `status: deprecated`; no other label applies,
#                                and it names the concept that replaced it
#                                when the newest **Deprecation** line in
#                                log.md links one
#
# The whole report also prints what ktl-curator ranks its queue by, so that
# no model counts or sorts it: each review date due within 30 days, each
# concept a person confirmed that is derived from one edited after that
# confirmation, how many other concepts rely on each concept, and Worth ten
# minutes today, the queue itself. "The curator's queue" below says how a
# relation's target is found.
#
# One fact comes from git and not from frontmatter, so a host without git is
# told it was not computed: whether a source "moved" after an event. The
# event is the later of `generated.at` and the newest `verified` event for
# the work list, and the newest confirmation by a person for the report. Git
# is asked for the commit that first recorded that event's time in the
# concept. A source moved when its own last commit comes after that commit in
# history, or when it carries an edit not yet committed and the concept does
# not.
#
# History orders the two, never a clock, so a source changed in the commit
# that recorded the event, as a squash merge leaves them, has not moved. An
# event not yet committed is the newest thing there is, and one git cannot
# find is left alone: the comparison can miss a moved source and never
# invents one. It is the file's history, not its meaning: an edit that
# changed no fact still counts, and only reading the source says which it
# was.
#
# An open question is "answered" here when a person confirmed the concept on
# or after the day the question is dated and the concept is no longer a
# draft: the person looked again after it was asked. ktl-curator clears a
# person's note on that person's word, and ktl-librarian withdraws its own
# with the pen's `resolve`.
#
# `quiet` says whether a scheduled run has anything to do, so the wrapper can
# skip the agent in a week when nothing happened. Work waits when:
#   - a source moved after its concept's stamp;
#   - a person left a note after the librarian last wrote or checked that
#     concept;
#   - reader feedback waits;
#   - a concept carries no stamp at all, as in the skeleton ktl-sidecar
#     installs: no `generated`, no `timestamp` and no `verified` event, so no
#     history can say what moved for it.
#
# A note's commit is compared with the stamp's as a source's is, so a note
# left in the commit that recorded the stamp is missed, and a note not yet
# committed is newer than any stamp. A bundle git holds no full history of is
# never quiet. A source given as a URL is never fetched, so it never makes a
# run busy: the wrapper's caller decides how often a run goes ahead
# regardless. It prints one line of counts, with no path and nobody's words.
#
# A moved source stops making work without a stamp in two cases, since the
# librarian has no more to do there until something changes again. The work
# list names both kinds apart from the sources that still wait.
#   - The concept carries an open question a process asked that names the
#     source's path, first committed at or after the source's last commit.
#     The librarian read that state of the source and put it to a person: a
#     confirmed concept whose source is gone, which only ktl-curator retires,
#     is the usual one. A question that names no source covers none, since it
#     may ask about anything. A source that is gone and that git never held
#     counts once any such question is on file. The source makes work again
#     when it moves after the question.
#   - A person closed the pull request that changed the concept, without
#     merging it.
#
# That second case comes from the librarian workflow, which reads what became
# of the pull requests it opened. It hands a scheduled run one file, named by
# KNOWLEDGE_DECLINED, holding the ones a person closed without merging,
# newest first:
#   declined <number> <YYYY-MM-DD closed> <the commit it was based on>
#   touched <path>    a concept that pull request changed or removed
#   added <path>      a concept it added
#   handled <hash>    git's blob hash of a feedback entry it handled
# A person said no to those changes, so nothing that pull request had before
# it counts as work: a source of a touched concept whose last commit is that
# base commit or an ancestor of it, a note a person left there no later, a
# touched concept with no stamp that has not changed since, and a feedback
# entry it handled. Each makes work again once it changes: the source moves,
# a person leaves a new note, a reader asks again. The work list names what
# was left and the concepts that pull request added, so that none is proposed
# twice. A run a person starts is handed no such file: starting it is the
# request to try again. A line in any other shape is skipped, and so is a
# pull request whose base commit is no ancestor of HEAD in this clone.
#
# `retrieval` measures what the index promises: that an agent reading only
# index.md can tell which concept to open. The questions are the ones readers
# asked, from the ledger in .lokf/questions.md that knowledge-apply.sh keeps.
# `--prompt` prints one prompt holding the table of contents and the numbered
# questions. An agent answers it with no tool, and a program scores the reply
# here. A question counts when a concept the ledger names for it is among the
# first three paths the reply gives. A question whose every concept has left
# the bundle is not asked and not counted, since no index could lead to it,
# and the score says how many were left out. The reply is read for answers
# only: what is expected of it comes from the ledger, in a file of its own.
#
# Bash 3.2, POSIX awk and git only, so it runs wherever the other sidecar
